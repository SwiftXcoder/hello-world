SwiftXcoder - Embracing Swift 2 as a language and posting everything I learn here

New coder here and I am sharing everything along the way with others.
Recommended reading: Swift 2 for Absolute Beginners (2nd edition)
by Gary Bennett and Brad Lees
Available from Apress (ISBN 978-1-4842-1489-3) ... or look on Amazon like I did!

Also follow Twitter account: @swiftxcoder for the latest stuff and diary.

Will post some of the code mentioned in the book (if copyright allows) but mainly extras that I have created and I think are relevant.
